    "1. Sometimes the outcome of an experiment can be expressed as a number. Other times we're most interested in numerical descriptions capturing some aspects of the outcomes.\n",
    "2. Random Variable (RV) is a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome in S. \n",
    "    ex: coin is tossed 3 times. 8 possible outcomes.\n",
